# beginner-kernel-exploitation-setup

## How to Install
- `./setup.sh`
- As a beginner friendly repository everything is hard-coded. By default, it will compiles a 6.4 kernel and a debian image from the syzkaller repository. If you want to further customize it, see the `./helpers/` folder.

## How to Run
- `./start.sh ./code/hello_world.c` for a first dry run. You can write your own C code and specifiy it
- When the qemu instance boots up you can type `root` and you're in. Then `./run` to install KRWX module and execute the compiled binary

## Requirements
Tested on x86_64 ubuntu machine. Ubuntu is not strictly required, but if you want to use another distro, change the `apt` command from `setup.sh` based on your distro (or comment the 2 lines and install necessary requirements by yourself). Except for these two lines

`sudo` is required for some operations (`grep -R sudo *` if you are suspicious)
